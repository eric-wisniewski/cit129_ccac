# About Me
Hello, I am a student currently enrolled at the Community College of Allegheny 
County. I have started this Github account to improve and display my skills in 
the coding language of Python for the course at CCAC, as well as show the 
millions of users on this site what I can accomplish. At the start of this 
course, I have taken the first installment of Python within the CCAC Data
Analytics program. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge with coding, 
not only from a personal level, but working inside and with a community to learn and 
gain more experience.
